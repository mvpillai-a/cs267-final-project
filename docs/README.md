# For CS267 Final Project:
Clone repo
cd into data and follow quickstart instruction to get sift tar and run code as mentioned
For small dataset test - go to data, `small.py` constructs dataset (adjust to desired size - currently 10pts with dim 2) and run if needed
10pt dataset already added to data
Run 10pt dataset with `./neighbors -R 2 -L 4 -alpha 1.2 -two_pass 0 \  -graph_outfile ../../data/data_10pts_graph \  -data_type float \  -dist_func Euclidian \  -base_path ../../data/data_10pts_2D.fbin`
For visualizing graph: load graphviz on perlmutter with 
```module load conda
conda create -n graphviz_env python=3.11 -y
conda activate graphviz_env
conda install -c conda-forge graphviz python-graphviz
```
Then run `visualize_graph.py`

# ParlayANN

ParlayANN is a library of approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, along with a set of useful tools for designing such algorithms. It is written in C++ and uses parallel primitives from [ParlayLib](https://cmuparlay.github.io/parlaylib/). Currently it includes implementations of the ANNS algorithms [DiskANN](https://github.com/microsoft/DiskANN), [HNSW](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib), [HCNNG](https://github.com/jalvarm/hcnng), and [pyNNDescent](https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To install, [clone the repo](https://github.com/cmuparlay/ParlayANN/tree/main) and then initiate the ParlayLib submodule:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
